# Navisens/Android-Plugin

This repo adds support for additional features on top of our [MotionDna SDK](https://github.com/navisens/Android-SDK) that can be used when building Android applications.

Make sure to complete setup of the Android SDK before proceeding with installing plugins.

All of the source code is provided, so if there are features that you need or would like changed, feel free to write your own plugins too, using the provided source as starter if necessary! If you are interested in publishing your own plugins, check out our tutorials [here](https://github.com/navisens/NaviDocs/tree/master/Tutorials).

The plugins system is an extension of the base functionality provided by the MotionDna SDK, and serves to make developing apps easier for you. While it's implementation is designed to work in the general case, it is advised that you customize or even use the native SDK if you have very specific needs not provided such as real-time performance-critical work.

## Setup

Plugins are compiled into your project by including the following repository in your project `build.gradle`

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...

        // Repositories for motiondnaapi SDK
        maven {
            url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public'
        }
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public'
        }

        // Repository for all plugins
        maven {
            url 'https://raw.github.com/navisens/Android-Plugin/repositories'
        }
    }
}
```

Then simply import `NavisensCore` along with any desired plugins (see below for full list) by adding any dependency with the format

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Add all dependencies required of our motiondnaapi SDK. Make sure to use the latest version!
    compile group: "com.navisens", name: "motiondnaapi", version: "1.2.2-SNAPSHOT", changing: true

    // Add the core plugin, and any plugins you want too
    compile 'com.navisens:navisenscore:<version>'
    compile 'com.navisens:<plugin name>:<version>'
    
    // OR design a custom plugin as a separate module
    compile project(':pluginmodule')
    
    // ...
}
```

For example, to import version 0.0.6 of our `NavisensMaps` plugin, use the following:

```gradle
    compile 'com.navisens:navisenscore:2.0.1'
    compile 'com.navisens:navisensmaps:0.0.6'
```

The source code for projects is also provided to allow for full customization.

## Core
